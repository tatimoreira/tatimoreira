I'm a Costa Rican based web developer creating cool web experiences ðŸŒˆ

Iâ€™m a passionate Web3 full-stack developer with a strong background in building scalable, decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain solutions for the web. I love to build responsive and performant front-end interfaces with React, Tailwind, Next.js and integrate them with blockchain solutions in Solana using Rust programming language.
